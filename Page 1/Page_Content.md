# The History of the Internnet 

* No one controls it. No one in charge. Control is shared between all switches. 
* First computers big as a room, were expensive. Took a day to for the punch card to have results. 
* Dr. Lawrence Roberts had built the first experimental connection between two computers at MIT.
* Interface Message Processor breaks down a large document into smaller packets, then independently sends it to the destination. It then reassembles the various packets to the long document at the destination. 
* BBN won the contract and began the work to create the system.
* The first node was put in UCLA in 1969.
* Email creation allowed for another form of communication to exist.
* The openness of the internet allowed for it to be developed quickly by anyone that had access. 
* Networks began to multiply in 1972.
* A common network of interconnected networks was formed in 1983. 
* In 1992, the internet was taken out of the government hands and into the hands of the common person.
